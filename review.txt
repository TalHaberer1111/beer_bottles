Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?

Looks good!

Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?

Yep!

Were branching and looping used effectively?

For sure!

Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?

The CSS looks good!  Bootstrap would have been too much!!!


Is the site user-friendly?

Absolutely!

Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?

It would have been nice to hear the sound of a beer opening every couple of seconds.

Great job, overall!
